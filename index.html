        <h3><b>Biography</b></h3>
        <p>I am Glory Edem fondly called "Lyka". I was born in 1998 definetely not a GenZ era. My accademic journey led my to 
          the University of Calabar, where  I emerged with a degree in Anatomy. With a heart as curious as a cat, a spirit as bright as a sunny day, and a stubborn streak to boot, 
          I fearlessly take on new challenges with an unyielding determination, regardless of the complexity.
          When I'm not engaged in academic pursuits, you can find me exploring my great passions in life: food and the cooking srt as well as basking in the serene ambiance of the beach for relaxation.
          I am fluent in English and Ibibio currently take a course on Italiano. My indoor loving tendencies makes me a true connoisseur of coziness.
          <p>
          I do call myself a DIY Dynamo effortlessly I navigate through the realms of sewing , crafting autogele, baking scrumptious delights and crafting beaded necklaces.
          My life's mantra is "Lyka, you've got this! It's not over until it's over"
          If you ever enter my space, I thrive in a pristine, organized environment and I do not tolerate things being out of place. I'm a hands-on problem solver ully equipped to tackle any issue that comes my way.
          With a simple click, I can find answers on how to attempt a thing or why or how to n the vast plains of the internet, be it YouTube, Darkweb or the quick Google search.
          <p>
            And yes, don't forget my endearing moniker, "Lyka". Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of Backend Engineering at AltSchool Africa, where I'll be making one line of code at a time. So, in this world of bits, bytes, algorithm, you can count on Mi bella to bring my unique blend of curiosity, tenacity and humor to the forefront.
